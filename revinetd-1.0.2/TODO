TODO for revinetd v 1.0.1

There are many things to do right now, here is a quick list:

Misc

- Portability needs to be increased.  This has been confirmed to compile
  under solaris 8 SPARC under gcc and cc, but testing needs to be done.
  Anyone with a SPARC sun station want to help?  We also need to test
  under other *NIX/architectures:  HP-UX, AIX, IRIX, OS/X, Linux-IA64,
  etc.  Net to Host and vice versa need to be wrapped for Endian-ness.

- Binary collection:  should we collect pre-compiled binaries for
  distribution via sourceforge?  

Communications channel:

- Out of Band model chosen.  It seems very stable.  Things we may need 
  to consider are: 

    SOCKSified proxy:  allow relay agent to act as a proxy client to
                       offer more connectivity options back to server

    SSL Support:  server only cerft or server+client cert support. encryption
		  would be on all connections between relay agents and servers.
                  This would benefit authenticating the relay agent and encrypting
                  the connection channel.
