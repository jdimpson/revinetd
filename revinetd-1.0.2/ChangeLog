Added bugfix for broken relase of relay agent.

12/9/2004
Added ability to chose the ip address to bind to with server mode.
This is ready for 1.0.1 release.


9/x/2004
Fixed connection to not require name resolution.  I encountered an older
server where this was broke.  inet_aton was also not available on this 
server, so we test for it on configure and use an older connection 
method.  

4/27/2004
Updated to 1.0

Hearbeat works and is tested
Makefile includes install ad behave with PREFIX chosen.

9/29/2003
Fixed keep alive.  Keep alive breaks when timeout occurs when select is consitently
thrown only relay agent port pairs.  It stays at a three minute timeout instead
of what is configured.

6/27/2003

Keep-alive is now a configurable option for the relay agent.  That way
if we have have a firewall with a quick timout on the connection 
tracking, we can keep the comm channel from going stale.

4/03/2003

Seem to have working keep-alive.

Server: when relay agent disconnects, server resets state.

3/19/2003

Updated configure.in to correctly compile under Solaris SPARC under cc
and gcc

3/14/2003

Remove references to mode.  OOB works so nice that this is how we intend
to operate only.

3/9/2003

The whole of the network code has been rewritten from scratch. It's
cleaner and it handles multiple concurrent connections, like web
browsing. Only -m out works, however.

2/13/2003

Major changes. A new switch has been added.  Mode (-m) will specify the
communication mode.  currently this is MODE_NONE which gives us crappy
connectivity issues like before, but still only uses one connection.  -m
out is Out-Of-Band (OOB) communication channel.  This allows us to have
control variables about client and target connections, so we can
simulate a forward data tunnel connect.  This is done through a second
connection which is the comm channel.  This connection is also initiated
from the relay agent and connects on the same port as the data tunnel.
This is so we still only need one port on the firewall open.  The
"protocol" on the data channel is very simple, it only communicates the
state of the connection on each side.  For now, specify -m out to enable
this.  The "none" mode is default, but will either go away soon, or
become an depereciated option for old compatibility (though this isn't
really old).
